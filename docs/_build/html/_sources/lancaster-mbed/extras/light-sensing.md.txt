#MicroBitLightSensor

##Operation
###Sensing Pins

If the current is inverted on an LED, it becomes sensitive to light. In particular
it is sensitive to the **same colour** of light it emits.

You will find that the Light Sensor on the micro:bit is more reactive to red light
than any other colour because that is the colour of light the display emits.

The display is architected with 3 rows, each with 9 columns. This is illustrated
below:

![light-sensing info graphic](../resources/light-sensing.png)

<center>*Where the format is: **ROW**.**COLUMN***</center>

On the micro:bit we have 6 analog pins, 3 are applicable to the display and reside
on columns 1, 2 and 3.

This means that we have 9 pins in total that we can sense light on if we are
fast enough to transition between emitting and sensing light.

The 9 sense pins are illustrated below:

 _____________________________
| 1.1 |     | 1.2 |     | 1.3 |
|_____|_____|_____|_____|_____|
|     |     |     |     |     |
|_____|_____|_____|_____|_____|
| 2.2 |     | 2.3 |     | 2.1 |
|_____|_____|_____|_____|_____|
|     |     |     |     |     |
|_____|_____|_____|_____|_____|
| 3.3 |     | 3.1 |     | 3.2 |
|_____|_____|_____|_____|_____|
```
</center>

The ADC takes around 4ms to settle and give accurate values with minimal current.
This places restrictions on our sensing window.

###Interleaving
In the current implementation, the display and the Light sensor can operate in an
interleaving manner. This interleaving is enabled due to a special display mode on the [display](../ubit/display.md)
which is automatically activated when `readLightLevel` is called by the user.

This special mode (`DISPLAY_MODE_BLACK_AND_WHITE_LIGHT_SENSE`), increases the rate of the `systemTick` callback to 5ms, and the
[display](../ubit/display.md) is thusly configured to drop the 4th frame for user processing,
which in this case, is entirely consumed by the light sensor. This reduces the display
refresh rate from 55Hz to around 50Hz.

To signify the window for user processing, the display will fire an event:

* *ID*: `MICROBIT_ID_DISPLAY`
* *Value*: `MICROBIT_DISPLAY_EVT_LIGHT_SENSE`

This will trigger an event handler in the `MicroBitLightSensor` class.

##Sensing Life Cycle

In the previous section we discussed how the [display](../ubit/display.md) and the Light
Sensor interleave. This section will cover the actual operation of the sensor during
the `MICROBIT_DISPLAY_EVT_LIGHT_SENSE` event.

<br/>

!!! note
    If you would like to manually trigger the Light Sensor, a few steps must be taken:<br/><br/>
    1) Disable the display so that the column pins are under the users' control.<br/>
    2) Construct an instance of `MicroBitLightSensor`<br/>
    3) Trigger the Light Sensor by firing a `MicroBitEvent` with the ID `MICROBIT_ID_DISPLAY` and the value `MICROBIT_DISPLAY_EVT_LIGHT_SENSE`.

####The Concept of Channels

As we previously discussed there are 9 pins we can sense light on. However, we face the problem
of interference from the state of other Columns.

We found that the best combination was to treat each of the three analog enabled Columns as a channel.
This leads our picture to look something more like this:

```
 _____________________________
|  1  |     |  2  |     |  3  |
|_____|_____|_____|_____|_____|
|     |     |     |     |     |
|_____|_____|_____|_____|_____|
|  2  |     |  3  |     |  1  |
|_____|_____|_____|_____|_____|
|     |     |     |     |     |
|_____|_____|_____|_____|_____|
|  3  |     |  1  |     |  2  |
|_____|_____|_____|_____|_____|
```
</center>
<center>*Where each number represents a different column, now named a channel as it is a collection of 3 rows*</center>

This reduces the resolution of our light sensing capabilities as we can
now no longer can use 9 pins to sense light, purely due to the unfortunate fact
that we obtain interference from other pins that cannot be mitigated.

However, we do gain an accurate picture of the overall brightness detected by the display.

We expose a mean representation of the light level from the 3 channels on the display.

####The Algorithm

**Upon receiving an event:**

* Set all rows to be a DigitalOut, with a value of 0.
* For the current channel:
    - Set the current channel pin HI.
    - Immediately transition the current channel to be an AnalogIn
* Attach an interrupt to occur 4ms into the future. (This allows our AnalogIn instance
to settle correctly)

**Upon interrupt:**

* Obtain our analog value.
* Release the pin from GPIOTE control. (*If we do not do these, this column will not
be useable in the display driver*)
* Move onto the next channel.

After these two phases have occurred, the display will now once again be available
for regular usage until the next interleave is signaled by the display.
