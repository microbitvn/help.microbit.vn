"| <div class=\"img-icon\">[![Microsoft "
"PXT](resources/logos/pxt.svg)](https://codethemicrobit.com/)</div> | The "
"Microsoft Programming Experience Toolkit (PXT) provides a programming "
"experience based around JavaScript. The experience has a built-in "
"progression from simple block-based editor, through in-browser text editor "
"with robust auto-completion and auto-fixing, all the way to a professional "
"integrated development environment, Visual Studio Code. |\n"
"| <div class=\"img-icon\">[![Microsoft Touch "
"Develop](resources/logos/touchdevelop.png)](https://www.microbit.co.uk"
"/create-code) </div> | With its touch-based interface, Touch Develop has "
"been designed for mobile devices with touchscreens. It can also be used with "
"a pc, keyboard and mouse. Touch Develop introduces a statically-typed "
"scripting language with syntax-directed editor. It can be used to produce "
"web-based apps that can run online on any platform. |\n"
"| <div class=\"img-icon\">[![Microsoft Block "
"Editor](resources/logos/blocks.png)](https://www.microbit.co.uk/create-"
"code)</div> | The Block Editor is a visual editor and provides an "
"introduction to structured programming via drag and drop coding blocks that "
"snap together. You can also convert a Block Editor script into a Touch "
"Develop script which helps with the transition to text-based programming. |\n"
"| <div class=\"img-icon\">[![Code Kingdoms "
"JavaScript](resources/logos/codekingdoms.png)](https://www.microbit.co.uk"
"/create-code)</div> | Code Kingdoms is a visual JavaScript editor. It has a "
"drag-and-drop interface making it accessible to beginners. You can also "
"change from the visual editor to a text-based editor which supports the "
"transition to text-based programming as the learnerâ€™s coding skills "
"progress. |\n"
"| <div class=\"img-icon\">[![MicroPython](resources/logos/python.png)](https:/"
"/www.microbit.co.uk/create-code)</div> | MicroPython is a completely text-"
"based editor, perfect for those who want to push their coding skills "
"further. A selection of 'snippets' are on hand to help auto-complete "
"trickier tasks and a range of premade images and music are built-in to give "
"you a helping hand with your code. |"
