#uBit.messageBus

##Overview

The micro:bit has an eventing model that can notify user code when specific things happen on the micro:bit.

For example, the [`MicroBitAccelerometer`](accelerometer.md) will raise events to indicate that the
micro:bit has be been shaken, or is in freefall. [`MicroBitButton`](button.md) will send events on a range of button up, down, click and hold events.

Programmers are also free (in fact, encouraged!) to send their own events whenever they feel it would be useful.

## Registering an event handler

The `MicroBitMessageBus` records which events your program is interested in, and delivers those `MicroBitEvent`s to your program as they occur
through a defined **event handler**.  

This is achieved through the `MicroBitMessageBus` `listen` function. This lets you attach a callback
to a function when a specified event (or events) occur.

You can also control the queuing and threading model used for your callback function on a per event handler basis.

This may sound complex at first, but it is actually very simple. For example, to find out when button A is clicked, write some code like this:

```cpp
#include "MicroBit.h"

MicroBit    uBit;

void onButtonA(MicroBitEvent)
{
    uBit.display.print("A");
}

int main()
{
    uBit.init();
    uBit.messageBus.listen(MICROBIT_ID_BUTTON_A, MICROBIT_BUTTON_EVT_CLICK, onButtonA);

    // We don't want to drop out of main!
    while(1)
        uBit.sleep(100);
}
```

Now, whenever the `MICROBIT_BUTTON_EVT_CLICK` event is raise by `MICROBIT_ID_BUTTON_A`, your code inside function `onButtonA` will be automatically run.

You can call listen as many times as you want to attached functions to each of the events that are useful for your program.

##Wildcard Events
Sometimes though, you want to capture all events generated by some component. For example, you might want to know when any changes in a button has happened.

In this case, there is a special event value called `MICROBIT_EVT_ANY`. If you call listen with this value, then ALL events from the given source component will be delivered to your function.

You can find out which ones by looking at the `MicroBitEvent` delivered to your function - it contains the source and value variable of the event.

For example, you could write a program like this:
```cpp
#include "MicroBit.h"

MicroBit    uBit;

void onButtonA(MicroBitEvent e)
{
    if (e.value == MICROBIT_BUTTON_EVT_CLICK)
        uBit.display.scroll("CLICK");

    if (e.value == MICROBIT_BUTTON_EVT_DOWN)
        uBit.display.scroll("DOWN");
}

int main()
{
    uBit.init();
    uBit.messageBus.listen(MICROBIT_ID_BUTTON_A, MICROBIT_EVT_ANY, onButtonA);

    // We don't want to drop out of main!
    while(1)
        uBit.sleep(100);
}
```

If you *REALLY* want even more events, there is also a `MICROBIT_ID_ANY` source, that allows you to attach a function to event generated from any component.

Use this sparingly though, as this could be quite a lot of events!

The following code would attach the `onEvent` function to receive all the events from the whole runtime:
```cpp
#include "MicroBit.h"

MicroBit    uBit;

void onEvent(MicroBitEvent)
{
    uBit.display.scroll("SOMETHING HAPPENED!");
}

int main()
{
    uBit.init();
    uBit.messageBus.listen(MICROBIT_ID_ANY, MICROBIT_EVT_ANY, onEvent);

    // We don't want to drop out of main!
    while(1)
        uBit.sleep(100);
}
```

## Defining a Threading Mode

Whenever you register a listener, you may choose the threading mode used with that handler. Every event handler can have its own threading mode, that defines when your handler
will be executed, and how it will react to receiving multiple events.

There are four permissible modes for event handlers. These are:

| Threading mode | Brief Description |
| ------------- |-------------|
| MESSAGE_BUS_LISTENER_IMMEDIATE | Handler is called directly from the code raising the event. Event handler is *not* permitted to block. |
| MESSAGE_BUS_LISTENER_DROP_IF_BUSY | Handler is executed through its own fiber. If another event arrives whilst the previous event is still being processed, the new event will be silently dropped. |
| MESSAGE_BUS_LISTENER_QUEUE_IF_BUSY | Handler is executed though its own fiber. If another event arrives, it is queued, and the event handler will immediately be called again once processing is complete. (default) |
| MESSAGE_BUS_LISTENER_REENTRANT | Every event is executed in its own fiber. if another event arrives, it is handled concurrently in its own fiber. |

These various modes provide great flexibility in how the runtime can be used to support higher level languages and applications. For example, `MESSAGE_BUS_LISTENER_IMMEDIATE` is ideal for very simple, lightweight handlers, as this will provide very timely response to events with a low processing overhead. However, it is easy to cause side effects on other parts of the code if it does not return promptly.
`MESSAGE_BUS_LISTENER_DROP_IF_BUSY` provide semantics identical to the Scratch programming language, and can be used to build easy to understand, asynchronous environments.

`MESSAGE_BUS_LISTENER_QUEUE_IF_BUSY` provides similar semantics, but with tolerance to avoiding loss of high frequency events.

`MESSAGE_BUS_LISTENER_REENTRANT` provides guaranteed causal ordering and improved concurrency, but at the cost of additional complexity and RAM.

You can define the threading mode you want to use on a per event handler basis as an optional final parameter to the listen function:
```cpp
#include "MicroBit.h"

MicroBit    uBit;

bool pressed = false;

void onButtonA(MicroBitEvent)
{
    pressed = true;
}

int main()
{
    uBit.init();
    uBit.messageBus.listen(MICROBIT_ID_BUTTON_A, MICROBIT_BUTTON_EVT_CLICK, onButtonA, MESSAGE_BUS_LISTENER_IMMEDIATE);

    // We don't want to drop out of main!
    while(1)
    {
        if(pressed)
            uBit.display.scroll("Pressed!");
        uBit.sleep(100);
    }
}
```

##C++ Event Handlers

It is also possible to write event handlers as C++ member functions. If you don't know what this means, then don't worry, as that also means you won't need it. :-)

For those programmers who do like to write C++, you can use a variation of the `listen` function to register your member function event handler.

This takes the same form as the examples above, but with an additional parameter to specify the object to call the method on. You are also required to specify your event handler using legal C++ syntax.

For example, you can write code like this to register an event handler in your own class:

```cpp
MyCoolObject::onButtonPressed(MicroBitEvent e)
{
    uBit.display.print("A");
}

MyCoolObject::MyCoolObject()
{
    uBit.messageBus.listen(MICROBIT_ID_BUTTON_A, MICROBIT_BUTTON_EVT_CLICK, this, &MyCoolObject::onButtonPressed);
}
```

Again, it is also possible to a threading mode as an optional final parameter:

```cpp
MyCoolObject::onButtonPressed(MicroBitEvent e)
{
    uBit.display.print("A");
}

MyCoolObject::MyCoolObject()
{
    uBit.messageBus.listen(MICROBIT_ID_BUTTON_A, MICROBIT_BUTTON_EVT_CLICK, this, &MyCoolObject::onButtonPressed, MESSAGE_BUS_LISTENER_IMMEDIATE);
}
```

## Removing Event Handlers

Event handlers can be dynamically removed from the message bus as well as added. To do this, use the `ignore` function. This takes precisely the same parameters as the
listen function, except that the threading mode argument is never used.

For example, to remove the event handlers shown above:

```cpp
uBit.messageBus.ignore(MICROBIT_ID_BUTTON_A, MICROBIT_BUTTON_EVT_CLICK, onButtonA);
uBit.messageBus.ignore(MICROBIT_ID_BUTTON_A, MICROBIT_BUTTON_EVT_CLICK, this, &MyCoolObject::onButtonPressed);
```

##Message Bus ID
| Constant | Value |
| ------------- |-------------|
| MICROBIT_ID_MESSAGE_BUS_LISTENER | 1021 |

The message bus will send a `MICROBIT_ID_MESSAGE_BUS_LISTENER` event whenever a new listener is added to the message bus.

This event allows other parts of the system to detect when interactions are taking place with a component. This is primarily used as a power management mechanism - allowing on demand activation of hardware when necessary.

##Message Bus Events

| ------------- |-------------|
| Message Bus ID of listener | 1-65535 |
