#uBit.radio

##Overview

The central processor unit (CPU) on the micro:bit is a Nordic Semiconductor [nRF51822](../resources/datasheets/nRF51822.pdf). In addition to being a general purpose
computer processor, this chip also contains a built-in 2.4GHz radio module.  This radio can be configured in a number of
ways, and is primarily designed to run the Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) protocol. However, it can also be placed into a much
simpler mode of operation based that allows simple, direct micro:bit to micro:bit communication.

The `MicroBitRadio` component is made up of three classes - `MicroBitRadio`, [`MicroBitRadioEvent`](radioevent.md) and [`MicroBitRadioDatagram`](radiodatagram.md). Together,
these provide the ability to send general purpose data packets from one micro:bit to another, and to extend a message bus to span multiple micro:bits...
so if you raise an event on one micro:bit, you can receive it on another using the normal [listen](messageBus.md) mechanism!

!!! note
    It is not currently possible to run the `MicroBitRadio` component and Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) at the same time. If you want to use the `MicroBitRadio` functionality, you need to disable the BLE stack on your micro:bit by compiling the runtime with `#define MICROBIT_BLE_ENABLED 0` in your `inc/MicroBitConfig.h` file.


## Capabilities

This component provides a very easy to use, flexible, broadcast radio channel. Anything you send from one micro:bit, can be received by any other micro:bits nearby.
It is designed to provide a powerful but simple introduction to the world of wireless communications, and can let you create a whole range of applications from
building your own friend detectors to creating remote control cars.

A key principle of this component is **privacy**, which is built in from the ground up. So, when you send any data, there is nothing inherent in this protocol
which can be used to identify you or your micro:bit. All devices look identical. Therefore, if you want to be able to identify yourself, you need to add this to your own data.

## Using MicroBitRadio

To write your radio enabled applications, you will likely want to use either the [`MicroBitRadioDatagram`](radiodatagram.md) class, or the [`MicroBitRadioEvent`](radioevent.md) class.

Both of these are created for you as part of the standard uBit object, so this is a choice, not a compromise! :-)

### [MicroBitRadioDatagram](radiodatagram.md)
This is the most flexible way to use the radio, and lets you easily send and receive up to 32 bytes of data at a time.
This data can be provided as array of bytes, a text string, or [`PacketBuffer`](../data-types/packetbuffer.md).

You can send a packet at any time using the `uBit.radio.datagram.send` function.

Any other micro:bits in range will detect the transmitted packet, and make the packet available through the
`uBit.radio.datagram.recv` function.

Any micro:bits receiving a datagram packet will also raise a `MICROBIT_RADIO_EVT_DATAGRAM` event to indicate
that some data is ready to be read.

For example, imagine you were creating a simple remote control car with one micro:bit acting as a remote controller, and another connected to some servos on the car.

You might decide that simply sending a `1` means turn left, and a `2` means turn right, so you may write a program like this for the remote control:

```cpp
#include "MicroBit.h"

MicroBit    uBit;

int main()
{
    uBit.init();
    uBit.radio.enable();

    while(1)
    {
        if (uBit.buttonA.isPressed())
            uBit.radio.datagram.send("1");

        else if (uBit.buttonB.isPressed())
            uBit.radio.datagram.send("2");

        uBit.sleep(100);
    }
}
```

...and one like this for the remote control car:


```cpp
#include "MicroBit.h"

MicroBit    uBit;

void onData(MicroBitEvent e)
{
    ManagedString s = uBit.radio.datagram.recv();

    if (s == "1")
    {
        uBit.io.P0.setServoValue(0);
        uBit.display.print("A");
    }

    if (s == "2")
    {
        uBit.io.P0.setServoValue(180);
        uBit.display.print("B");
    }
}

int main()
{
    uBit.init();
    uBit.messageBus.listen(MICROBIT_ID_RADIO, MICROBIT_RADIO_EVT_DATAGRAM, onData);
    uBit.radio.enable();

    while(1)
        uBit.sleep(1000);
}
```

### Using PacketBuffers
If you prefer to send a raw series of bytes rather than a text string (which is much more common in communication networks), you can use the [`PacketBuffer`](../data-types/packetbuffer.md) type.
This gives total freedom over the data being shared. Simply create a [`PacketBuffer`](../data-types/packetbuffer.md) of the size you need, and you can read or write data using standard C
array syntax.

For example, here is an similar program using a [`PacketBuffer`](../data-types/packetbuffer.md):
```cpp
#include "MicroBit.h"

MicroBit    uBit;

int main()
{
    uBit.init();
    uBit.radio.enable();

    // Create a packet containing just a single byte.
    PacketBuffer b(1);

    while(1)
    {
        b[0] = 0;
        if (uBit.buttonA.isPressed())
            b[0] = 1;

        else if (uBit.buttonB.isPressed())
            b[0] = 2;

        uBit.radio.datagram.send(b);
        uBit.sleep(100);
    }
}
```

...and one like this for the remote control car:


```cpp
#include "MicroBit.h"

MicroBit    uBit;

void onData(MicroBitEvent e)
{
    PacketBuffer p = uBit.radio.datagram.recv();

    if (p[0] == 1)
    {
        uBit.io.P0.setServoValue(0);
        uBit.display.print("A");
    }

    if (p[0] == 2)
    {
        uBit.io.P0.setServoValue(180);
        uBit.display.print("B");
    }
}

int main()
{
    uBit.init();
    uBit.messageBus.listen(MICROBIT_ID_RADIO, MICROBIT_RADIO_EVT_DATAGRAM, onData);
    uBit.radio.enable();

    while(1)
        uBit.sleep(1000);
}
```

### [MicroBitRadioEvent](radioevent.md)

It is also possible to transparently send and receive events over the `MicroBitRadio` channel. This can provide very simple and easy to integrate
support for event driven applications. Once configured, an event raised on one micro:bit can be detected on another - in the just the same way as
a local event such as a button click.

To use this functionality, all that is needed is to register the event codes that you would like to be sent over the radio, then write event handlers
for the message bus as with all other events. See the documentation for the [`MicroBitMessageBus`](messageBus.md) for details of how to write
event handlers.

For example, if you wanted to share an event SOMETHING with another micro:bit whenever ButtonA is pressed, you might write code like this on the sending micro:bit:

```cpp
#include "MicroBit.h"

MicroBit    uBit;

#define MY_APP_ID           4000
#define SOMETHING           1

int main()
{
    uBit.init();
    uBit.radio.enable();

    // Ensure the radio is listening out to forward our events
    uBit.radio.event.listen(MY_APP_ID, MICROBIT_EVT_ANY);

    // Just for varierty, this time we'll periodically check to see if a button if pressed.
    // We can, of course, use an event handler for this too.
    while(1)
    {
        if (uBit.buttonA.isPressed())
            MicroBitEvent(MY_APP_ID, SOMETHING);

        uBit.sleep(100);
    }
}
```

...and on the micro:bits wanting to receive the event:


```cpp
#include "MicroBit.h"

MicroBit    uBit;

#define MY_APP_ID           4000
#define SOMETHING           1

void onSomething(MicroBitEvent e)
{
    uBit.display.scrollAsync("Something!");
}

int main()
{
    uBit.init();
    uBit.messageBus.listen(MY_APP_ID, SOMETHING, onSomething);
    uBit.radio.enable();

    while(1)
        uBit.sleep(1000);
}
```

### Defining Groups

It is easy to imagine situations where you would like to have different groups of micro:bits communicating independently.

For example, consider a classroom where 8 groups of four children are working on different
projects - it would not be very useful if packets sent by one group interfered with the other groups!

To address this, the `MicroBitRadio` allows users to define a **group** to which their micro:bit belongs.

micro:bits can only ever be a member of one group at a time, and any packets sent will only be received by other micro:bits in the same group.

Groups are simply numbers, and a micro:bit's group can be set at anytime by the programmer through the `setGroup` function. If a group is not specified, the default group of 0 will be used.

For example:
```cpp
#include "MicroBit.h"

MicroBit    uBit;

int main()
{
    uBit.init();
    uBit.radio.setGroup(10);
}
```
