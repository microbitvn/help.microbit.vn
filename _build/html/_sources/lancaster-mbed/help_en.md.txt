If you have any questions about the software or the hardware
for the micro:bit, please visit our [stack exchange site](http://area51.stackexchange.com/proposals/96237/microbit/) as
someone may have already answered your question! If they haven't, ask away!

!!!note
    This site is currently in the proposal stages of the StackExchange process, and
    will hopefully become a fully fledged StackExchange area.

If you have found an issue with our **documentation**, or if something is not clear
in the documentation, please file an issue on the [microbit-docs github repository](https://github.com/lancaster-university/microbit-docs/issues).

If you have found an issue with the **runtime software**, please file an issue on the
[microbit-dal github repository](https://github.com/lancaster-university/microbit-dal/issues).
