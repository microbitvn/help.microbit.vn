"The micro:bit runtime provides an easy to use environment for programming "
"the BBC micro:bit in the C/C++ language, written by Lancaster University. It "
"contains device drivers for all the hardware capabilities of the micro:bit, "
"and also a suite of runtime mechanisms to make programming the micro:bit "
"easier and more flexible. These range from control of the LED matrix display "
"to peer-to-peer radio communication and secure Bluetooth Low Energy "
"services. The micro:bit runtime is proudly built on the [ARM "
"mbed](https://www.mbed.com)  and [Nordic nrf51](http://www.nordicsemi.com) "
"platforms."

"In addition to supporting development in C/C++, the runtime is also designed "
"specifically to support higher level languages provided by our partners that "
"target the micro:bit. It is currently used as a support library for all the "
"languages on the BBC [www.microbit.co.uk](http://www.microbit.co.uk) "
"website, including the Microsoft Block Editor, Microsoft Touch Develop, Code "
"Kingdom's JavaScript and Micropython languages."
